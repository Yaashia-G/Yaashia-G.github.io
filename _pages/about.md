Hi, I'm Yaashia Gautam! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Engineering](https://www.colorado.edu/ecee/) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am advised by [Professor Marco Nicotra](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/nicotra). My research is centered around robotic controls and manipulation. I am developing on making robots contact friendly, and leverage methods in control theory to do so. I am particularly interested in leveraging the intersection of AI/ML and control theory to develop better methods for human-robot interaction keeping safety considerations in mind.



Before coming to CU Boulder, I completed my Master's in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California, where I researched with [Professor Quan Nguyen](https://sites.usc.edu/quann/) on using Model Predictive Control for the control of collaborative quadruped robots.
