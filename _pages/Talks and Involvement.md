## Teaching

**University of Michigan**

Sole instructor for sections of 15-20 students:

1. Math 116 (Calculus II) - Winter 2022, Fall 2022.
2. Math 115 (Calculus I) - Fall 2021.

**Monsoon Math Camp**

*Cut, Fold, Paste: Homology and the Classification of Surfaces*, 2021

Description: How many truly different shapes can you get by pasting polygons at their boundaries? This course explores the classification of surfaces, illustrating the concept using combinatorial objects and tools like the Euler characteristic and homology.

Prerequisites: Comfort with sets, functions, and induction. Visual intuition and familiarity with graphs are helpful.

Verdict: The course had lower prerequisites and a gentler pace than previous ones, leading to better student engagement and understanding.
